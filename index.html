            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>I have just recently completed my undergraduate degree at University College Dublin and am now a postgraduate student at the University of Leeds.

            </p>
            <p>I am currently at the earliest stages of my MSc in Geographical Information Systems and have just begun to dabble in the exciting world of programming. However the dabbling has been short lived and I have just completed my first assignment for Programming for spatial Analysts: Core Skills.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>The first assignment</h3>
            <p>For this assignment I attended a number of practicals, each of which involved constructing additional components of code which were then incorporated into the final model. Each of these practicals were under the supervision of Dr. Andrew Evans. To follow is a brief discussion regarding the information learned during these practicals which aims to allow you, the reader, to better understand the stages in which the final model was built. It must also be noted that in keeping with best pratice, comments have been added to the code in order to supplement your learning.</p>
            <p>The building of the model program began with creating variables that represented two agent locations for example the y and x coordinates. Next, their steps were randomized and the Euclidian distance between them calculated using Pythagoras’ theorem. This is a key element as agents need to know who is nearby so they can decide whether or not to interact with them.</p>
            <p>Next, were containers (particularly lists) and soon after some key control flow statements which dramatically reduced and enhanced the code. Classes and objects were then included so that the code could be converted into an object orientated version. This included creating an agent class which was made in the agentframework.py module. Within this new module, random was imported and the agents set up within the _init_ method which allowed for making the self.y and self.x variables that were then assigned to the value within random.randint(). The next step involved making the move() method within the agent class. At this point we were inside the class/agent objects and not outside them looking at them in a container.</p>
            <p>After this practical, a CSV reading code was applied to import a txt file that contained raster data for the agents environment. Next, was to ensure that all agents had access to the data. For example, in the final model agents are working together in the environment and every agent has access to a shared list of all the agents. This was so that the agents can transfer resources and information between themselves.</p>
            <p>In the following practical, the objective was to get the agents to communicate with one another and in order to do so a number of steps had to be undertaken. First, was the construction of another behavioural method such as those that already exist e.g. move() and eat(). This function has been called share_with_neighbours and is set to get the agents to search for close neighbours and share their resources. In order to do so, the loop containing the num_of_agents had to be adjusted to include both share_with_neighbours and neighbourhood. Once this was working the model had a basic agent communication set up.</p>
            <p>The next step was to add animation to the model with additional functions from matplotlib. A number of adjustments were made with the inclusion of the generator function which controls the models stopping condition. At the final stages of the models construction, a Graphical User Interface was added. This involved adding code from the lecture and making a menu associated with the function run. Lastly, some web data was scraped and used to initialise our model. At this stage the model was complete and running successfully.</p>
            <p>The above paragraphs may have been brief but I do hope it has helped you to gain a better understanding of how the final model was built. By writing this summary it has afforded me the opportunity to revise previous lectures and praticals which will undoubtedly be beneficial for future projects.
