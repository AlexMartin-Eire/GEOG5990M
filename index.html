  <h3 style="text-align:center;">About me</h3>
  
  <p style="text-align:center;">I have just recently completed my undergraduate degree at University College Dublin
  and am now a postgraduate student at the University of Leeds.</p> 
  <p style="text-align:center;">I am currently at the earliest stages of my MSc in Geographical Information Systems
  and have just begun to dabble in the exciting world of programming.
  However the dabbling has been short lived and I am now entrenched in a battle
  involving me and a blank spyder page.</p>
