            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>I have just recently completed my undergraduate degree at University College Dublin and am now a postgraduate student at the University of Leeds.
                <a href="http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/study/masters/courses/msc-in-gis/" target="blank"><img src="Leeds.jpg" alt="Leeds" style="width:65px;height:40px;border:0;">
                </a>
            </p>
            <p>I am currently at the earliest stages of my MSc in Geographical Information Systems and have just begun to dabble in the exciting world of programming. However the dabbling has been short lived and I have just completed my first assignment for Programming for spatial Analysts: Core Skills.</p>
            <h3>The first assignment</h3>
            <p>For this assignment I attended a number of practicals each of which involved constructing additional components of code which were then incorporated into the final model. Each of these practicals were under the supervision of Dr. Andrew Evans. By briefly discussing the practicals I too can share the information learnt so as you the reader may better understand the final model. It must also be noted that in keeping with best pratice, comments have been added to the code in order to supplement the readers learning.</p>
            <p>At the earliest stages of the practicals the main model program began to be built and contained variabales representing two agents locations for example the y and x coordinates for each.</p>
