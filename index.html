	<h3>About me</h3>
	<p>I have just recently completed my undergraduate degree at University College Dublin
and am now a postgraduate student at the University of Leeds.</p> 
<p>I am currently at the earliest stages of my MSc in Geographical Information Systems
and have just begun to dabble in the exciting world of programming.
However the dabbling has been short lived and I have just completed my first assignment for Programming for spatial Analysts: Core Skills.</p>
